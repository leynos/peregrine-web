# User Guide

This guide explains how to use the generated Peregrine Web project after
rendering it from the template.

## First Steps After Rendering

Initialize version control and stage the rendered files before running any
gate:

```sh
git init
git add -A
make all
```

The spelling gate enumerates its inputs with `git ls-files`, so `make all`,
`make markdownlint` and `make spelling` have nothing to check until the
project is a Git repository with its files staged.

## Generated Tooling

Generated projects use Rust 2024, a pinned nightly toolchain, strict lint
settings, and documented starter code. Library projects render `src/lib.rs`.
Application projects render `src/main.rs`, `src/lib.rs`, release automation,
and `[package.metadata.binstall]` metadata for binary installation.

Development builds use Cranelift for debug code generation. On Linux targets,
`.cargo/config.toml` configures clang to link with `mold` so local debug builds
link quickly. Coverage generation uses `lld` instead because LLVM coverage
tools expect LLVM-compatible linker behaviour.

## Validation and Environment Policy

This project denies `unknown_lints`, `renamed_and_removed_lints`, `unsafe_code`,
and `missing_docs`. Rustdoc denies `missing_crate_level_docs`,
`broken_intra_doc_links`, `private_intra_doc_links`, `bare_urls`,
`invalid_html_tags`, `invalid_codeblock_attributes`, and `unescaped_backticks`.
Clippy denies `missing_assert_message` and uses `disallowed_methods` to reject
direct calls to process-environment readers, iterators, and mutation functions.
Warnings are validation failures; these policies are not advisory.

Code that depends on environment variables must receive `mockable::Env` (or a
narrow equivalent closure) as a dependency. The production composition root
constructs `mockable::DefaultEnv`, while tests use `mockable::MockEnv`.
In-process tests must not mutate the process environment or serialize mutation
behind `Mutex`, `OnceLock`, or `serial_test`. The only mutation exception is an
end-to-end test using `assert_cmd`: `Command::env` and `Command::env_clear`
configure the isolated child process, not the test harness.

`make lint` builds documentation with Rustdoc warnings denied before running
Clippy and Whitaker. `make test` exports warning-denial flags to the selected
test runner and separately runs all-feature workspace doctests with Rustdoc
warnings denied. A warning from normal tests, the documentation build, or a
doctest therefore fails the command.

### Migrate an Existing Project

1. Copy the current `[lints.clippy]`, `[lints.rust]`, and `[lints.rustdoc]`
   policy into each package manifest, or opt every workspace member into
   equivalent workspace lints.
2. Add the current `disallowed-methods` entries to the workspace-root
   `clippy.toml`.
3. Update the Makefile so `make lint` passes mandatory `RUSTDOCFLAGS` to
   `cargo doc` and `make test` passes them to workspace doctests. Preserve
   mandatory flags when appending inherited flags.
4. Declare the current `mockable` dependency, refactor direct `std::env` reads
   behind an injected `mockable::Env`, and replace in-process environment
   mutation with `mockable::MockEnv`. Wire the environment adapter at the
   composition root and construct `mockable::DefaultEnv` only in production.
5. Update contributor guidance in `AGENTS.md` to document the injection
   boundary and the `assert_cmd` child-process exception.
6. Add diagnostic messages to assertions and crate/module/public-item
   documentation where the denied lints require it.
7. Run `make check-fmt`, `make lint`, `make typecheck`, and `make test`. Fix
   every warning rather than suppressing or downgrading it.

## Makefile Targets

The generated `Makefile` exposes these public targets:

- `make all` runs formatting checks, linting, tests, and spelling checks.
- `make check-fmt` verifies Rust formatting.
- `make fmt` formats Rust and Markdown sources.
- `make lint` builds documentation, then runs Clippy and Whitaker, with every
  warning denied.
- `make typecheck` type-checks the workspace without building.
- `make test` runs `cargo nextest run` when cargo-nextest is installed and
  falls back to `cargo test` otherwise. It denies warnings in normal tests and
  in the separate all-feature workspace doctest run.
- `make build` builds the debug target.
- `make release` builds the release target.
- `make coverage` writes `lcov.info` using `cargo llvm-cov` and `lld`.
- `make audit` derives the Rust workspace root with `cargo metadata` and runs
  `cargo audit` once from that root. In PR CI, Dependabot runs skip `make
  audit` and the audit-only setup when `github.actor` is `dependabot[bot]`, so
  whole-lockfile advisories do not block unrelated dependency updates. Human PRs
  still retain the audit gate, and `.github/workflows/audit.yml` runs weekly and
  can also be triggered manually as the compensating control.
- `make markdownlint` checks Markdown files and enforces en-GB-oxendict
  spelling.
- `make spelling` runs the shared `typos-config-builder` gate. It regenerates
  `typos.toml` from the live shared dictionary and the `typos.local.toml`
  overlay, then checks Markdown prose, so `typos.toml` is never drift checked
  in CI. The generated file is ignored; keep repository-specific exceptions in
  the tracked `typos.local.toml` overlay. The gate enumerates its inputs with
  `git ls-files`, so the project must be a Git repository with its files
  staged; `make spelling` fails with that instruction when it is not. The first
  run writes the ignored `typos.toml` in the working tree.
- `make nixie` validates Mermaid diagrams.

Install `clang`, `lld`, `mold`, `python3`, and `cargo-audit` before running the
full generated workflow locally on Linux.

## Scheduled Mutation Testing

Generated projects include `.github/workflows/mutation-testing.yml`, a scheduled
GitHub Actions workflow that runs mutation testing with `cargo-mutants`. It is a
thin caller of the shared `leynos/shared-actions` `mutation-cargo` reusable
workflow.

Mutation testing measures test-suite quality. It introduces small changes
(mutants) into the source and confirms the tests fail in response. A surviving
mutant marks a code path the tests do not meaningfully exercise, so promote it
into a new test rather than ignoring it.

The workflow runs on a daily schedule (09:15 UTC by default) and can also be
started manually from the **Actions** tab with **Run workflow**. Scheduled runs
mutate only files changed within the detection window, so routine runs stay
fast; a manual dispatch mutates the whole crate, fanned out across shards.
Because the runs are scheduled rather than gating pull requests, they surface
coverage gaps without slowing day-to-day CI, and they do not block merges.

When adopting the workflow in a new repository, stagger the cron slot: pick an
unclaimed daily time to avoid concurrent runs across related repositories. The
`mutation` job runs with a least-privilege token (`contents: read` plus
`id-token: write` for workflow-source resolution).

Results land in the run's job summary: a final job posts per-target outcome
counts and a table of surviving mutants, and each shard uploads its
`mutants.out/` directory as a `mutation-report-*` artefact. When nothing
relevant changed, the run writes a skip message and finishes in seconds.
Surviving mutants and timeouts are informational and leave the run green, so a
red run means something actually broke — a usage error, an already-failing test
baseline, or an internal error. Watch for those through GitHub's notifications
for failed scheduled runs.
